# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PONGGG

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Going to make a working pong game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'm not too sure yet, but I think I will have a start button for the game. After starting the pong ball will move. Whatever the balll hits it will bounce.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

Luka Janic but not sure.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

Do you want me to give you an estimate time? Maybe two weeks???

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO

I will make a visual aspect of the game, not sure if it will work.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will also work. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Maybe like a scoring board, and it can be multi player...

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO

Patience because coding takes a lot of dedication. New skills such as making a game, but also coding skills in the journey. I will also be more than happy if my teammate may answer back because this is suppose to be a fun learning process. I will research more about the love2d app as I am very new to this program.
